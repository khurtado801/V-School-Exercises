# StringManipulation
http://coursework.vschool.io/03-string-manipulation/

Install readline-sync
Make one of the inputs all uppercase (i.e., given the string “hello” print “HELLO”)
Report back the number of characters in a given input
Concatenate (add) two separate strings together
Given a long message (more than twenty letters), return only the last half of the message
Using the same long message (but without making the user type it in again), have your program print it to the terminal for the user to read again, but allow the user to tell your program where to begin typing from (i.e., which index to start from).
