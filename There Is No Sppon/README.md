In order to practice translating real-world objects into code, look around the room and pick 10 things you can see. Then write them as 10 JavaScript objects.

Each object should have at least 3 properties and one method, but you can add as many properties/methods as you want if you want to get even more practice. Try to not make everything a String type too, but include some Numbers, Booleans, Arrays, nested Objects, etc. if you can.
