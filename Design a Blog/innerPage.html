        <p>One of the many beautiful things about web design is the near-limitless options available to us. Yet, still, our navigation systems seem stuck into the existing preformed solutions. For small, personal sites, a simple top horizontal navigation
            bar is the typical option.</p>
        <h2><a href="//sixrevisions.com/web-standards/trying-navigate-website-navigation/">Trying to Navigate Website Navigation</a></h2>
        <p>Having clearly labeled navigation types to choose from can help people organize the information more easily. For us professionals, having standardized nomenclature allow us to discuss and explore the subject. Even information architecture (IA)
            experts like Lou Rosenfeld, Steve Krug, Jesse James Garrett, and Jakob Nielsen don't agree as to what "secondary navigation" is.</p>
        <h2><a href="//sixrevisions.com/user-interface/responsive-menus/">8 Ways to Add a Responsive Navigation Menu on Your Site</a></h2>
        <p>There are plenty of techniques for implementing responsive navigation menus on your site. This article talks about eight excellent open source projects for building responsive navigation menus. At the end of the article, you will find a summary
            table that has links to the official site, demos, usage guide, and official open source repository for each project.</p>
        <h2><a href="http://sixrevisions.com/usabilityaccessibility/information-architecture-101-techniques-and-best-practices/">Information Architecture 101: Techniques and Best Practices</a></h2>
        <p>Without a clear understanding of how information architecture (IA) works, we can end up creating sites that are more confusing than they need to be or, worse, make our content virtually inaccessible. This guide covers the fundamentals of information
            architecture for organizing website content. We will look into popular IA design patterns, best practices, design techniques, and case examples.</p>
